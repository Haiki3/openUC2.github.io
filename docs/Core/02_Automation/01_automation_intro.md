- 1x openUC2 LED array (3 circles)

- 10x Baseplates 


**Not in Cubes:**

- 1x Objective lens (10x, finite)
- 1x openUC2 Electronic (ESP32-based)
- Box + Foam insert

- Controller
- 12V Power Supply 


## Finite-corrected digital Microscope


In the following you will learn to build the finite-corrected microscope that helps you imaging microscopic sample using a digital webcam. It features a stepper motor-based Z-stage with a resolution around 300nm/step in case 16 microsteps are used. Additionally the ring-shaped led-array will enable digital phasecontrast of your transparent sample. 

Once done, the microscope will look like this:

</p>

Based on the following image, take the following cubes:

- Webcam 
- Z-stage
- 45Â° Folding Mirror
- Sample Mount
- LED Array

Start concatenating the puzzle pieces to form an L-shape and place the different cubes on top of it to end up with this assembly:

</p>

Ensure that the LED array is either in the same cube as the sample or optionally add one more layer on top of the sample such that you end up with a 4-layer "tower".

</p>

Once done, the microscope features a folded beampath with a tubelength of ~100mm, which is less than the required 160mm following the RMS standard for finite-corrected objective lenses. This means, that the magnification will slightly less. However, this setup should give you and impression how you can build small microscopes that can be automated on the fly.

### Controling the microscope with a browser

The motor and the led array are connted to the UC2 electronics module. For additional information, please have a look [here](https://openuc2.github.io/docs/Electronics/uc2e2#-wiring)

In order to control the hardware components, we make use of the newly implemented Web-Serial (Chrome only for now). Alternatively, you can checkout the Python interface. More information available [here](https://openuc2.github.io/docs/Electronics/uc2e7#-python-bindings)

The link to the installation-free Web-Serial interface (Experimental) is here: https://youseetoo.github.io/indexWebSerialTest.html
