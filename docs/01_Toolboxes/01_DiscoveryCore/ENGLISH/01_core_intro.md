**Sample holder:** holds an object in a cube\
**Lens:** affects the way light is propagated (spread out)\
**Mirror:** Reflects the light\
**Microscope objective:** a special lens system that enlarges an object

A quick tour through an exemplary box and how the cubes look like (state Oct. 2022) can be found here:

## What is UC2?

The core element of the UC2 project is a simple cube.
The cube consists of two halves and houses a sliding insert.
The insert can hold various optical components (e.g. lenses, mirrors), which means that different functions can be implemented with each cube.

### Cube type 1: injection molded with plug connection

**Baseplate**

**Baseplate**

The cube can be mounted on a base plate. The base plate modules can be put together like a puzzle.

## UC2 for printing yourself

The UC2 cube can also be 3D printed. It looks the same as the injection molded model, but here it consists of a cube lid and the cube body, which are held together with screws. The screws are great for being put on the magnetic plate. By combining different cube modules, different optical structures can be easily assembled. A new function can be added with each dice. Your creativity knows no limits.

### Cube type 2: 3D printed with magnetic connection

**Dice**

**Base plate with magnets**

In the 3D printed base plate there are small spherical magnets on which the cubes are placed.

Want more dice? Then you can build them yourself. You can find everything [here](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT)



## This is how the dice fit together
Duration: 1

Make sure that the cubes are placed correctly on the plate and are not tilted. In the end it is important that the inserts are in the right place.

If you don't see a sharp image, move the inserts (e.g. lens) until you see it clearly. The green arrow in the picture shows you how to do this.

Here you can find a small video that explains the core concept of the cube

## What can a lens do?
Duration: 2

Take one or more of the cubes that have a lens in them and look at the UC2 symbol shown here. Hold the cube in your hand and change the distance between the lens and the image.
